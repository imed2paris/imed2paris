### Who I am
I live in the north-east of Paris.
I have a degree in Applied Mathematics from the University Pierre et Marie Curie, with a specialization in Probability and Statistics.
With a master's degree in Applied Mathematics, I am a very rigorous Data Scientist, with a strong sense of organization, autonomy and perseverance. 

I have three years of experience as a Software Developer in a startup I co-founded.
During this work experience, I was responsible for the design and implementation of mobile applications.
I have demonstrated my autonomy and adaptability, and have gained coding best practices through my professional activities.

Afterwards, I wanted to pursue my career in the field of data processing and management.
Indeed, I could use my professional experience as a Software Developer to maintain and monitor data pipelines within organizations.
So I decided to update my knowledge by attending a bootcamp specialized in Data Science training.

### What I am interested in
I enjoy running, hiking and going to the movies.
Speaking of films, my favorites are the ones dealing with the mafia, criminal investigations or closed-door situations.
As you will have understood by reading my bio, I am a passionate of criminal investigations, whether they are described in movies, series, books, other online videos published by enthusiasts.
No matter where the story takes place, the profile of the victims or the murderers, I like to hear, watch or read these kinds of stories (except when children are involved in these dramas of life).
But how do I explain my interest in this topic? I think there is a connection between criminal investigation and problem solving in mathematics.
In both cases, we follow a hypothetical-deductive approach in which we must make inferences based on hypotheses in order to progress in the investigation or resolution of the problem.

### What I am learning
Since I started working on data projects from start to finish, I have become more concerned with what we hope to achieve and how to get there in the least amount of time.
I am currently looking to get better at managing data projects and analyzing certain types of data.
By data project management, I mean the understanding of a problem diagnosed by an organization, the translation of this problem into a data project that could lead to a solution, the optimization of the phases 
of a data project in terms of productivity.
The other area of skill improvement includes the main steps of time series analysis with R and Python, the correct interpretation of factor analysis results with R, the best ways to create effective 
dashboards using Power BI, the best practices to follow in Natural Language Processing via Python.

### What I wish to collaborate on
I have previously shown how my skills are a perfect match for the Data Scientist position.
In the future, I want to use the opportunities this position provides to help people.

In the short term, my main concern is to gain experience in data analysis in a wide range of business areas.

In the medium term, I would like to have the opportunity to participate in projects aimed at proving the innocence of people unjustly sentenced to prison.

In the long term, it would be an extremely rewarding experience to work on projects whose goal is to help solve unsolved cases or find missing persons.

In addition, I would like to work on projects related to my interests : recognition of movements in sports, in particular boxing ;  studies on the film industry (distribution networks, influence of release dates, 
comparison with video platforms, ...) ; projects involving games that develop cognitive skills, such as Gem puzzle.

### How to read the projects
The projects I have worked on are presented here to illustrate my ability to collect, prepare, visualize, interpret data.
I tried to study problems related to various branches of the industry.

I mainly realized all these projects with the same machine whose operating system belongs to the Windows suite.
So far, I use the Python ecosystem to help me solve the problems I have decided to investigate. 
I analyze the available data and implement possible solutions in several notebooks.

Moreover, I wanted to show some aspect of the data analysis profession in my portfolio.
The available data do not always allow us to find a satisfactory solution to the problem studied, so there is no guarantee of obtaining an acceptable answer to the problem raised.

The processing of projects follows the same presentation scheme :
* in the ReadMe file of each repository, I present the context (Business Understanding), i.e. the subject of the project, the goal I want to reach, the problems I encountered during the execution, the 
technologies I used (mainly Python packages so far),
* in the Data Understanding phase, developed in one or more files, I give an overview of the analyzed data by revealing the metadata and some descriptive statistics,
* in the Data Preparation phase, I clean and format the data before moving on to the next phase; in concrete terms, I delete records if necessary, I change the type of some variables, numerical features are 
normalized, categorical features are dummyfied,
* in the Modeling and Evaluation phase, developed in one or more notebooks, I use several Machine Learning algorithms to identify patterns in the data (unsupervised learning) or to predict the target variable 
(supervised learning); I analyze the results of each algorithm, I end by giving the conclusion of the project where I compare the results and give the chosen solution to the problem raised at the beginning of 
the project.
